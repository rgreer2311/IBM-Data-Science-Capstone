# IBM Data Science Capstone - SpaceX

The capstone is a real world project similar to what data scientists and data analysts work with in real life. The objective is to assume the role of a Data Scientist working for a startup intending to compete with SpaceX and follow the Data Science methodology involving data collection and wrangling, data visualization, model development and evaluation, and reporting. The goal is to predict whether the first stage of the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket will land successfully and determine the cost of the launch in order to enable the company to make more accurate and informed bids.
